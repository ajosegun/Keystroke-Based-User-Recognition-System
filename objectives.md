### Description: 
The objective is to build and deploy a Machine learning model for user recognition based on keystroke data and is consists of 2 separate parts.

#### Part 1 – Building Model

The objective of this part is building ML models for user recognition based on their keystroke data. keystroke dynamics is a behavioural biometric which utilizes the unique way a person types to verify the identity of an individual. Typing patterns are predominantly extracted from computer keyboards. the patterns used in keystroke dynamics are derived mainly from the two events that make up a keystroke: the Key-Press and Key-Release. The Key-Press event takes place at the initial depression of a key and the Key-Release occurs at the subsequent release of that key.

In this step, a dataset of keystroke information of users is given with following information: 
• Train_keystroke.csv: in this dataset the keystroke data from 110 users are collected. All users are asked to type a 13-length constant string 8 times and the keystroke data (key- press time and key-release time for each key) are collected. The data set contains 880 rows and 27 columns. The first column indicates UserID, and the rest shows the press and
release time for first to 13th character. 

You should do following steps:
1. Usually, the raw data is not informative enough, and it is needed to extract informative features from raw data to build a good model. In this regard, four features (Hold Time “HT”, Press-Press time “PPT”, Release-Release Time “RRT”, Release-Press time “RPT”) are introduced and the definition of each of them are described in Fig 1.
2. For each row in Train_keystroke.csv, You should generate these features for each two consecutive keys.
3. After completing previous step, you should calculate mean and standard deviation for each feature per row. As a result, you should have 8 features (4 mean and 4 standard deviation) per row.
4. By using 8 generated features and UserID as class, build and train three ML models (1. SVM 2. Random Forest 3. XGBoost). (No need for feature selection, cross validation or parameters tuning, you should just train models on all data based on default parameters of each classifier)
5. Store the three trained models in your local device.

#### Part 2- Deploying Model
These three models will be deployed as a single API to use them in real time, and served as a Rest API. 
This API gets inputs as json format and return the prediction result. 
The input for API should contains the model type (SVM, RF, XGB) and mean and std of HT, RPT, PPT and RRT. 

The sample format of input is as follow:
{
  “Model”: “RF”,
  "HT": {
          "Mean": 48.43,
          “STD”: 23.34
         }, 
  "PPT": {
          "Mean": 120.43, 
          “STD”: 37.41
          },
  "RRT": {
          "Mean": 124.43,
          “STD”: 45.34
          }, 
  "RPT": {
          "Mean": 132.56, 
          “STD”: 47.12
          }
}

When The API is called with propriate inputs, it should load the related model (based on “Model” value in input) and predict the UserID and return it.

For model deployment AWS cloud was used for model deployment.
